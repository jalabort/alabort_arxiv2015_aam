\begin{abstract}+
Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are one of the most common and well-established Deformable Models (DMs) techniques in computer vision. In this paper, we present a unified and complete optimization framework for fitting AAMs to images. We classify existent optimization algorithms with respect to three main characteristics:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item the method used to handle appearance variations; 
\item the algorithm used to solve the non-linear optimization problem; and 
\item the type of composition employed. 
\end{inparaenum}. We provide new valuable insights into existent appearance variations strategies by reinterpreting them as a direct application of the Wiberg algorithm. 

Furthermore, we extend the previous framework by proposing two new types of compositional algorithms for fitting AAMs, i.e. Asymmetric and Bidirectional. We show these compositional algorithms can be interpreted as \emph{Efficient Second order optimization Methods} that effectively combine the advantages of existent first (robustness and accuracy) and second order (fast convergence) methods.



comparable or superior accuracy  complexity than Gauss-Newton and, consequently , enjoy faster convergence properties while being as robust and stable as which we prove ha


extend the previous framework by re-interpreting recently proposed appearance variation strategies as direct applications of the Wiberg algorithm and by proposing two new types of compositional algorithms for fitting AAMs, i.e. Asymmetric and Bidirectional, which we prove. 

We review the probabilistic formulation of AAMs fitting and derive a complete probabilistic formulations for all existent and novel algorithms naturally obtained by changing our prior belief within this framework.


An open-source implementation of all the algorithms described in this paper is available as part of the Menpo Project \footnote{\url{http://www.menpo.org}}.
