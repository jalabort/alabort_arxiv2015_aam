\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item Adapt existent learning-based descent algorithms for face alignment to AAMs and study their relationship with the gradient-based descent algorithms described in this paper. 
\item Study the impact that locally-defined warps have in improving the perfomance of AAMs.
